# Usage

You can run SymFusion using:
- a Python wrapper: quick way of running the tool without setting variables, creating directories, etc.
- a Rust wrapper: this is an improved version of the wrapper proposed by SymCC. Faster than the Python wrapper but requires a few preliminary operations. 

We also show how to use SymFusion in a hybrid fuzzing setup with AFL++.

## Concolic execution (Python wrapper)



## Concolic execution (Rust wrapper)

## Hybrid fuzzing (AFL++)
